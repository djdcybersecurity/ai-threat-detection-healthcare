# **AI-Based Threat Detection and Response System for Small Healthcare Organizations**  

## **üìå Project Overview**  
Cybersecurity threats in healthcare are increasing due to the industry's reliance on digital health records and interconnected systems. Small healthcare organizations, such as clinics and private practices, face a higher risk because they often lack dedicated IT security teams and advanced threat detection capabilities. This project aims to develop an **AI-driven cybersecurity framework** that autonomously detects and mitigates threats in real time.  

## **üéØ Objectives**  
- Develop a **machine learning-based** threat detection system for small healthcare organizations.  
- Evaluate its accuracy, recall, and false-positive rate using real-world cybersecurity datasets.  
- Implement an **automated response** mechanism to mitigate threats effectively.  
- Provide **recommendations** for AI-powered cybersecurity solutions in small healthcare environments.  

## **üõ†Ô∏è Methodology**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection**  
- Utilize publicly available cybersecurity datasets: **UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017**.  
- Simulate network traffic to train AI models on real-world attack scenarios.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development**  
- Implement **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Deep Learning Networks**  
- Utilize **Feature Engineering** to extract network traffic patterns.  
- Develop **Anomaly Detection** algorithms for identifying cyber threats.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ System Testing & Optimization**  
- Test models on realistic attack scenarios (e.g., **phishing, malware injection**).  
- Optimize model accuracy and response time while minimizing false positives.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Evaluation & Deployment**  
- Generate a **comparative analysis report** on AI performance in threat detection.  
- Prepare a research paper and presentation for **UReCA Showcase**.  

## **üìä Expected Outcomes**  
‚úÖ A functional **AI-based cybersecurity model** tailored for small healthcare organizations.  
‚úÖ An evaluation report measuring the effectiveness of AI in reducing cyber threats.  
‚úÖ A **research paper** for potential publication in cybersecurity and AI journals.  
‚úÖ A **presentation** showcasing the AI system and its impact.
